# Everything I Wish I Knew When I Started Using GitHub

# git.io - URL shortener
git.io is a URL shrinker and has a ruby gem `gitio` to use from the CLI

# Patch files from PRs
Add `.patch` to the end of a PR URL and you'll get a patch file.

# Repo Network
PRs work between repos and don't have to be applied to the main repo. You can create PRs between forks.

# Close an issue from a Merge comment
In a comment, you can add `closes #<issue-id>` to close a related issue. There are other similar commands like `fixes`.

# Gists
Gists are backed by a full git repo. You can clone and add/modify gists directly.
