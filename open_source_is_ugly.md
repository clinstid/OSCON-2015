# Designers aren't well represented in open source projects
* Reliance on tools that may not be open source or do not exist. Designers have a hard time creating this tools themselves.
* Design culture/attitude leans more towards competition and criticism than collaboration.

# Likely roles for current designers in open source
* Friends
* Mercenaries - hired by companies and end up working on open source as a side effect
* Hybrid designer/developer

# Open source can be done by anyone, but in order to be successful, you need:
* Sense of community
* Motiviation

Better UX/UI design can also be done by developers, you don't need to be a professional designer, but some guidance can be helpful:
