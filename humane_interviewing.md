# Humane Interviewing
- It starts with our attitude - interviewing is not war or grilling, it's an evaluation of a potential co-worker.
- Be prepared, deliberate about each step in the process and iterate on that process.
- Communicate relentlessly - Even if you aren't going to make an offer to a candidate, you want them to leave with a positive view of your company and feel like they weren't dropped on the floor.
- Be kind! If a candidate is faltering, turn the session into a learning experience so both you and the candidate can leave the interview with at least some good coming out of it.
